# Sodalite for Obsidian

## About

This is the relatively opinionated Sodalite theme for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). Inspired by in part some Windows 10 and 11 design ideas (Fluent, Mica). The theme only supports dark mode, as of v0.1.

Tested with Obsidian v0.12.15.

I've made several other useful snippets and tidbits, these are available at my obsidian-toolkit repo: https://github.com/tomzorz/obsidian-toolkit

## Relatively Opinionated?

### Unusual title formatting

As Obsidian prominently features the note title in a separate title-bar outside of the document itself, this theme scales that title up to H1 size.

### Unusual status bar placement

To save on the typically limited vertical screen space, the theme moves the status bar into the right side of the title bar.

## Installation

In Obsidian, navigate to **Settings > Appearance > Themes** - you should be able to find it in the list there.

Alternatively, download the `sodalite.css` file to you vault's `.obsidian/themes` folder and select it under **Settings > Appearance**.
