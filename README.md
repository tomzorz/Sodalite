# Sodalite for Obsidian

## About

This is the relatively opinionated Sodalite theme for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). Inspired by in part some Windows 10 and 11 design ideas (Fluent, Mica). The theme only supports dark mode, as of v0.1.

Tested with Obsidian v1.3.4.

I've made several other useful snippets and tidbits, these are available at my obsidian-toolkit repo: https://github.com/tomzorz/obsidian-toolkit

## Relatively Opinionated?

### Unusual title formatting

As Obsidian prominently features the note title in a separate title-bar outside of the document itself, this theme scales that title up to H1 size.

### Unusual status bar placement

To save on the typically limited vertical screen space, the theme moves the status bar into the right side of the title bar.

## Installation

In Obsidian, navigate to **Settings > Appearance > Themes** - you should be able to find it in the list there.

Alternatively, download the `sodalite.css` file to you vault's `.obsidian/themes` folder and select it under **Settings > Appearance**.

## Recommended Settings

Sodalite is optimized for the following appearance settings:

- appearance > advanced > show inline title **OFF**
- appearance > advanced > native menus **OFF**
- appearance > advanced > show tab title bar **ON**
- appearance > advanced > window frame style **Hidden**

## Snippets

Sodalite offers CSS snippets to alter certain smaller aspects of the theme.

| File name                  | Description                                                      |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| content-max-width-1100.css | Limits maximum width of content to 1100 px and center aligns it. | 
| content-max-width-900.css  | Limits maximum width of content to 900 px and center aligns it.  |
| content-max-width-700.css  | Limits maximum width of content to 700 px and center aligns it.  |

These can be found in the `snippets` folder of the repository.
